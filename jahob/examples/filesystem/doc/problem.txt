
Problem: Need to verify consistency of on disk data structures

Disk abstraction: a set of Blocks
Each block has a type:
     bootblock
     superblock
     inodesblock 
     datablock
	files
	directories

Disk class parametrized with disk size and inode count
     returns Blocks given  buffer array
     --> no: inode undefined at this level of abstraction

Subsystem should load byte[] array from disk through buffer cache, then wrap
it with the appropriate disk block wrapper
   - block types:
	   InodesBlock
	   SuperBlock
	   DataBlock
		File
		Directory

   - implement block loader(understanded disk layout of superblock , inodes, etc)
	   abstractly represents 
		      - inode set
		      - super block
		      - data block set 

Problem: Want to avoid making wrapper classes for the byte[] retrieved from the buffer cache,
		but need to type the arrays.
